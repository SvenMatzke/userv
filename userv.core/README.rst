The catch
=========
The first start for every webserver is routing and parsing html.
This is the core.


Routing
=======
Router objects are simple and are input to the server instances.
Example:
::

    from userv.routing import Router, text_response

    router = Router()

    def test(request):
        return text_response("some text")

    router.add("/resturl", test, method="GET")

you can get function test again with:
::

    router.get('/resturl', method="GET")


for creating swagger and so on there is a also a list command:
::

    router.list()

With these routes in one place we have full control even without
an server instance.

Response types
==============
There are a few build in response types text, json and static files.

The general gist of the response functions is to create a generator
which will be used to consumed by your server.

if you want to have full control about your memory flow or need to write a few
memory hungry responses feel free to write an response yourself.

Little hint make sure to use the response_header function and end the response with
an "\\r\\n".


Serve static files
==================
It is pretty simple just add the address with the file you want to serve.

Example:
::

    from userv.routing import static_file

    router.add("/index", static_file('boot.py'))

Although the example should never expose your code. It is a pretty simple and fast test.


Swagger your api
================
swagger.io is the a good way to document your api. This section is a quick way to serve an swagger.json
from your server. To view the api you can embed a swagger_index.html with cdnÂ´s.

Example for description:
::

    # Get requests have a parameter description
    @swagger.info("My_funny summary")
    @swagger.parameter('myvarname', description="", example='sdfs', required=True)
    @swagger.response(200, 'smth is off')
    def myrest_func(request):
        raise


    # Post request needs a body description
    @swagger.info("My_funny summary")
    @swagger.body('weatherinfo', {'tada': "examplevar",
                                  "tada2": 2})
    @swagger.response(200, 'smth is off')
    def post_myrest_func(request):
        raise

    router.add("/resturl", myrest_func, method="GET")
    router.add("/resturl", post_myrest_func, method="POST")



Example to serve swagger.json:
::

    from userv.swagger import swagger_file, swagger_index
    router.add("/rest/swagger.json", swagger_file('my swagger api', "api title", router_instance=router))

    router.add("/rest/index.html, swagger_index(host="127.0.0.1", swagger_json_url="rest/swagger.json")

the example shows we add the router_instance and therefore all routes registered to that point.
meaning if you want all routes in your swagger add the swagger_file shortly before running.

Now all you need to do is set proper host adresses and call up the index url in one or your browsers.
Because this is IoT always have in mind qr-codes and other links are easy to create and glue on your device.

Further packages & webserver
============================
Atm there is an implementation for an socketserver which runs even on on esp8266::

    pip install userv.socket_server

And an async server with an exchangable interface.::

    pip install userv.async_server
